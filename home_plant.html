                            indoor gardening. This is really important for those countries and zones which receive
                            very less hours of
                            sunlight. Owing to recent technological advancements, especially the usage of LED grow
                            lights, indoor

                            carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, while the human body does exactly complete opposite.
                            Having plants in and
                            around your house will drastically improve the quality of air you breathe. Many air
                            purifier plants filter the
                            air around the plants and absorb toxic gases such as benzene and formaldehyde. You can

                            starts to yellow and die back.

                            Who doesn’t love fragrant and fresh coriander on a steaming bowl of
                            gravy or on a tropical salad? These tiny leaves are bound to add a beautiful aroma every
                            dish they are added to.
                            And it’s extremely easy to grow them on your own.

                            Take a handful of coriander seeds and press them slightly to break them into two. Soak
                            the broken seeds in water
                            overnight.
                            Mix sand, red soil, cocopeat, neem cake and compost in equal quantities to make the
                            potting mix.
                            Drain this potting mix well and scrape lines through it to sow the seeds.
                            Spread the seeds evenly along the scraped lines. Cover the seeds lightly with soil and
                            dry leaves. Sprinkle with
                            a little water.
                            After the seeds have sprouted, spray with diluted buttermilk or Panchagavya once every
                            15 days. Do not overwater
                            the plants.
                            Harvest the Coriander once it’s ready.

                            Keep aside a few sprigs of mint from a fresh bunch you got from the market.
                            Choose a healthy, thick stem and make a cut at around 15 cm along the length, below the
                            node. Remove a few
                            leaves gently from the cutting.
                            Put a few such cuttings in a glass of clean water. Keep indoors, away from sunlight.
                            In a few days, the cuttings will sprout new leaves and grow roots. You can use the

                            that it grows really fast

                            Once true leaves start appearing, space out the saplings around six inches apart to
                            allow ample space for each

                            Pick the leaves whenever needed. Leaves will continue to regrow until the end of the
