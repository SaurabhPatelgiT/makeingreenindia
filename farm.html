            <Font size="4px">Modern farms and agricultural operations work far differently than
              those a few decades ago, primarily because of advancements in technology, including sensors, devices,
              machines, and information technology. Today’s agriculture routinely uses sophisticated technologies such
              as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and GPS technology. These advanced devices
              and precision agriculture and robotic systems allow businesses to be more profitable, efficient, safer,
              and more environmentally friendly.

              Indoor vertical farming is the procedure of growing plants in closed and controlled environments.
              With this method, plants mounted vertically, and it takes less land space to grow compared to
              traditional farming. Vertical farms don’t require soil for plants to grow, and in this method, the
              labour force reduced too. It is the best and the first smart farming technique in India.
